Quick Start (use= Google Colab - Easiest!)

Dowload the data mentioned below 
 Data You Need
1. MRI Brain Scans (Required)
Get train.parquet5,120 brain MRI scans for trainingHack4Health competition and test.parquet1,280 brain MRI scans for testingHack4Health competition

2. Clinical Data (Auto-downloaded)
The notebook automatically downloads clinical data from Kaggle - no action needed!

If you prefer to run on your own computer:
bash# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hack4health-alzheimers.git
cd hack4health-alzheimers

# 2. Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Add your data files to the data/ folder

# 4. Open and run the notebook
jupyter notebook Hack4Health_Final_Submission.ipynb


How It Works
MRI Model (ResNet50)
Brain Scan Image → ResNet50 Neural Network → Diagnosis
                   (pretrained on 14M images)

## 🧠 Model Output

**One of 4 classes:**
├── 0: Non-Demented
├── 1: Mild Demented
├── 2: Moderate Demented
└── 3: Very Mild Demented

Code

## ⚙️ Clinical Model (MLP)

**Pipeline:**  
`32 Patient Features → Neural Network → Diagnosis`

**Features include:**
├── Age, Gender, Education
├── BMI, Smoking, Exercise
├── Family History, Diabetes
├── MMSE Score, Memory Complaints
└── ... and more



 Limitations

Small sample for Mild Demented class (only 49 images)
Clinical data is synthetic (for educational purposes)
MRI and Clinical data are from different patients (not true multimodal)
